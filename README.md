This is a Hangman project I created in December of 2021 for my college class CSC 160. It involves using C++ via Visual Studio to create Hangman.
When starting the game you are able to choose from two overall difficulities, Casual and Competetive. These differ how fast the words get complex or how likely the word is to be known.
Within these overall settings there are three levels within them making a total of six levels. Afterwards the game randomly selects a word from the difficulty list which can be founds under: 
  "CSC160_awalz_Final" -> "LevelX(Casual/Comp)" (eg. Level1Comp)

  Disclaimer: As this was made for continuing my education the program may not be flawless and may no be the most optimized version possible
